Bank Account Project Peer Review
***********************************************************************************************
Peer reviewer 1: The program ends immediately so the goodbye message is not visible when in debug mode.

Some clutter in the source code could be reduced with loops and exit characters.

2nd Reviewer: The program works very well, very clear instruction as far as depositing and withdrwaing money from account very well.

- Also like how you set up the statement that the user has to enter in decimal for (or add cents)
- very good structure and userability
- liked the use of transline. 




****************************************

Okay, first, your programs always look so CLEAN and spiffy.  Is that a word?  I see you handled the "too many decimals" problem that I failed to notice.  "Invalid Entry" Very, very nice. 

Holy crap! You used Regex in here!  Expertly done!  I keep trying to break your code, and no dice of course.  Beautiful execution of that validity checkpoint.  

Lovely code that here appears
Slate wiped clean with console.clear()
Your project so neatly done
If this were a contest... you would have won. 

^_^



**************************************


It is set up very nicely.

There is no message when exiting the program.


It might make things even cleaner if you put the title in a met
d and called when you need to display it rather then rewritting it all the time

nit picking (cause I am out of things to say and we have a ton of time left) but I think it is nice to show the balcane when you make a deposit or withdraw so its clearer to the user what is happening
